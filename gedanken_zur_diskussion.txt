Dragut and Blaschke
In their classification scheme, which is loosely based on DIkau(1989), they chose 2° as the crisp slope threshold defining flat areas and 45 for steep slopes, whereas other values in the classification system are fuzzy.

Englisch & Killian:  auch 2° for flat areas,5 for schwachgeneigt,10 mäßig geneigt

Mishimye:The catchment generally has undulating topography with gentle to moderate slopes. 
SRTM, ASTER GDEM, GEOEYE (based on 5m stereoimages);  ecognition
The GEOEYE DEM (created from GeoEye stereo-images) was the most effective in producing land component boundaries that coincide with morphological discontinuities.

 Classification was performed at resolutions of 50, 100, 200 and 400 m. The coarser DEM resolutions were obtained by resampling the original 50 m DEM using a mean resampling method. Tables show the cluster means of gradient (tangent) and curvatures for the different landforms

Discussion.The examination of the defuzzified classifications identified resolution as a dominating factor in landform identification and classification. 

Hughes et al: 
As the major aim of the DTM is to identify hillslope elements, we regard an interpolated grid resolution of 15 m as adequate to represent those structures. window of 9 × 9 cells, 
A hillslope position index (Schmidt and Hewitt, 2004) was used in combination with slope gradient and curvature to define land elements. The land elements used have been applied successfully to soil-landscape modelling of steeplands in the Canterbury foothills, New Zealand (Schmidt et al. 2005b)

Schmidt and Hewitt:
 A DTM of 15-m grid size 
Model parameters: window size: 135 m, slope thresholds: 2–10°, curvature thresholds: 1/500–1/200 1/m.The final land element model is derived by combining the form classification with the higher scale terrain classification. 
For example, slope thresholds, subdividing backslope units from ridges and valleys, depend on the local characteristics of the landform, i.e. the gradient of the slopes and valleys. Global thresholds, as used in the presented technique, are regarded as producing poor results
he results show that it is possible to derive land elements for steepland areas based on geometry and landscape context using a relatively simple model. 

Barka et al: Of the alorithms analysed in the presented work, Barka et al investigated the best parameter combinations based on the kappa statistic comparing the landform classification with forest and soil type mapes for Wood's and the TPI-based classification algorithm.
Setting Wood: slope threshold 1°, curv tolerance 0.002 and window size 170m
Setting Dikau: The classification of landforms elements according to Dikau [5] was not able to identify bottoms of wider
valleys (wie bei uns )The best threshold value of curvature tolerance in testing regions and DEMs was 0.003
Setting TPI: r1 100m and r2 900m
Method of J. Wood is the most promising algorithm for classification of landforms for forestry and pedological
predictive mapping. It is highly configurable and this increases its applicability in different types of relief.

Bolongaro Crevenna:central mexico; Each calculated morphometric class was compared with the relief visualized on an altitudinal 3D-DEM. The best fit occurred with slope tolerance values of 6 degrees and convexity tolerance values of 1x10^-4. Compared the classes with manually delineated geomorphological map

Dann: welche issues und mögliche verbesserungen
aus Schmidt and Hewitt:
A series of issues have been identified that could be used to improve the methodology, including (a) spatially variable scale, (b) locally adaptive thresholds, (c) improved modelling of landscape position, (d) better rules describing neighborhood relationships and geomorphometric context, and (e) the form and connectivity constraints of land elements. These issues are discussed in the following paragraphs.


SLOPE: compared to values found in literature, the slope thresholds in our analysis are much higher.
