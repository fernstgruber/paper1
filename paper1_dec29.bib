  Abstract                 = {Traditional manual methods have been employed for decades to measure geomorphometric properties from topographic maps. Such measurement techniques tend to be tedious and time-consuming and the designated landform elements cannot be easily overlaid on any digital map and imagery for further applied research. This study deals with a new quantitative geomorphometric procedure, based on the multivariate statistical analysis of local topographic gradients within a part of north-central Crete. This method employs sets of computer algorithms that automatically extract and classify geomorphometric properties from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). This was done by evaluating the morphological setting around each pixel of the DEM along the eight azimuth directions. ISODATA unsupervised classification was implemented to generate 10 morphometric classes showing the spatial distribution of areas with a similar geomorphic scenario. Results revealed that this approach permitted a quick estimation of the spatial distribution of morphologically homogeneous terrain units. It also demonstrated the ability of the delineated landform elements to be superimposed on any digital map and imagery for further investigation. This became apparent during the examination of the relationship between the geomorphological units and the land-cover/land-use types in the study area. Both relative association and the dominant land cover/land use types in relation to geomorphological units are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The increasing global coverage of high resolution/large-scale digital elevation data has allowed the study of geomorphological form to receive renewed attention by providing accessible datasets for the characterisation and quantification of land surfaces. Digital elevation models (DEMs) provide quantitative elevation data, but it is the characterisation and extraction of geomorphologically significant measures (morphometric indices) from these raw data that form more informative and useful datasets. Common to many geographical measures, morphometric measures derived from DEMs are dependent on the scale of observation. This paper reports results of employing a fuzzy c-means classification for a sample DEM from Snowdonia, Wales, with a number of morphometric measures at different resolutions as input, and morphometric classification of landforms at each resolution as output. The classifications reveal that different landscape components or morphometric classes are important at different resolutions, and that morphometric classes exhibit resolution dependency in their geographical extents. Examination of the scale dependency and behaviour of morphometric classifications of landforms at different resolutions provides a fuller and more holistic view of the classes present than a single-scale analysis.},

  Review                   = {##Beschäftigt sich mit sehr grober Auflösung...und behauptet unter 100 m zu viel noise, aber vielleicht wollen wir das ja ? DEMS: the caharcterization and extraction of geomorphological significant measures(morphometric indices) form very informative and useful datasets. ..scale dependent...different landscape components or morphometric classes are important at different resolutions... Use of geomorph. significant measures is morge linked to process than statistical or fractal measures. he clear definition of morphometric classes has been questioned recently, and morphometric classes have been reconceptualised as vague or fuzzy sets (Fisher et al., 2004, 2005; Irvin et al., 1997; Lagacherie et al., 1997). Other researchers using inductive methods have employed unsupervised classification with a variety of morpho- metric derivatives as input to an automated morpho- metric classification of landforms (Burrough et al., 2000; de Bruin and Stein, 1998; Irvin et al., 1997; Lagacherie et al., 1997; Macmillan et al., 2000; Ventura and Irvin, 2000). Burrough et al. (2001) have gone on to use the same approach in mapping the topo-climatic structure of forest. All these studies of automated classification have employed the fuzzy c-means classification (Bezdek et al., 1984), and they have also worked only at the resolution of the original DEM, ignoring the uncertainty associated with the change of resolution. This paper describes a fuzzy c-means analysis of a DEM representing an area in Snowdonia, Wales, and builds on the studies mentioned above by examining the change in morphometric classes identified at different resolutions. Fuzzy c-means is the fuzzy equivalent of a c-means classification, an unsupervised technique that identifies the natural clusters and groupings of the input data in geographical space (Bezdek et al 1994). In the present classification, only gradient and plan and profile curvature were used. the focus is specifically upon exploring the scale dependence of morphometric class and their associated fuzzy memberships at different resolu- tions of analysis. Classification was performed at resolutions of 50, 100, 200 and 400 m. 4 - 7 clusters were used Examination of cluster memberships also highlights land surface elements (pixels) that exhibit characteristics of more than one landform class. Inferring process from form, these distributions and landform similarities could imply patterns of erosional and depositional processes. The ridge clusters can be seen as very local, spatially correlated features that form connected networks, in contrast to Boolean classifications where the ridge may frequently be broken by other morphometric classes. Zeigen ein nettes diagram bezüglich 'resolution based changes to ridge recognition', bei 50m werden viele als planar ausgewiesen... the strongly converging slope is also a class which is significantly differen to other landforms. it is felt that a resolution of 50 m is too sensitive to surface noise and therefore impairs the success of geomorphometric interpreta- tion, which necessitates the separation of surface noise from morphometric signatures. Arrell et al applied clustering based on elevation derivatives for morphometric landform classification and explain that the highest resolution did not reulst in the best results due to noise and also emphasize that relevance of different scalees form different landscape components. Fuzzy c-means classification Gut für discussion, we also have better results at a resoltuion of 50m compared to 10 m .},

  Abstract                 = {Digital soil mapping in mountain areas faces two major limitations: the small number of available observations and the non-linearity of the relations between environmental variables and soil properties. A possible approach to deal with these limitations involves the use of non-parametric models to interpolate soil properties of interest. Among the different approaches currently available, Support Vector Regression (SVR) seems to have several advantages over other techniques. \{SVR\} is a set of techniques in which model complexity is limited by the learning algorithm itself, which prevents overfitting. Moreover, the non-linear approximation of \{SVR\} is based on a kernel transformation of the data, which avoids the use of complex functions and is computationally feasible; while the resulting projection in feature space is especially suited for sparse datasets. A brief introduction to this methodology, a comparison with other popular methodologies and a framework for the application of this approach to a study site in the Italian Alps is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract As soils are facing considerable changes in climate, land use, land consumption, and degradation, it is vital to understand the characteristics of soils and their distribution, especially for soil management issues. In mountainous regions like the Alps, soils require specific attention as they provide a large variety of ecological functions, but also because of their vulnerability. However, pedological research and the collection of soil data in the Alps are still limited. On the one hand, there are specific methodological problems linked to the surveying, interpretation, and classification of Alpine soils due to their high variability over short spatial ranges and the peculiarities of the Alpine environment in general. On the other hand, the process of collecting soil data and mapping soils, as well as the soil classification systems used, significantly differs among the Alpine countries. The Alpine Convention therefore requires data harmonization as a basis for national and cross-country collaborations, soil monitoring, and sustainable management. This paper is an initial national expert-based review, which deals with the status of soil classification and soil mapping and related problems in the Alpine region. In the first part we highlight the current state of soil databases and soil maps in the Alpine area, as well as efforts toward soil data harmonization. We summarize the national soil mapping and soil inventory programs, monitoring activities (e.g., Soil Quality Monitoring, Soil Management Survey, Forest Monitoring), and soil information systems available in the main Alpine countries Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia and Switzerland. Second, we present the soil classification systems which are in use in the Alpine area. It is discussed to what extent these systems can reflect the characteristics of Alpine soils. In this context, we also examine the relevance of organic matter and humus forms. We then outline problems of comparability between the classification systems as well as challenges to classifying Alpine soils in general. In the third part – as soil classification and soil mapping are two different matters from a methodical point of view – we highlight basic challenges to soil surveys in the Alpine environment. We conclude that Alpine-wide shared soil site mapping and soil classification standards covering the specifics of Alpine soils are lacking. Thus, the main aim for the international management of Alpine soil resources should be to develop a framework for the basic soil information that is to be gathered by means of cross-border collection in the entire Alpine space, and to harmonize the already existing data. The former should include an upgrade of an existing international soil classification, e.g., the World Reference Base \{WRB\} (IUSS, 2014). },

Thus, it is possible to automatically build reproducible digital soil maps, helping to speed up field mapping and to reduce costs. The main objective of this chapter is to compare the ability of different data-mining techniques and algorithms from statistics and information theory, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), linear regression, learning vector quantisation and classification trees. The techniques are discussed in terms of prediction accuracy and usability for GIS-based usage. Altogether 10 data-mining algorithms were tested to predict soil classes on the basis of 65-terrain attributes. Prediction accuracy is tested inside and outside the learning area to compare their generalisation ability},

  Abstract                 = {The amount of scientific literature on (Geographic) Object-based Image Analysis – GEOBIA has been and still is sharply increasing. These approaches to analysing imagery have antecedents in earlier research on image segmentation and use GIS-like spatial analysis within classification and feature extraction approaches. This article investigates these development and its implications and asks whether or not this is a new paradigm in remote sensing and Geographic Information Science (GIScience). We first discuss several limitations of prevailing per-pixel methods when applied to high resolution images. Then we explore the paradigm concept developed by Kuhn (1962) and discuss whether GEOBIA can be regarded as a paradigm according to this definition. We crystallize core concepts of GEOBIA, including the role of objects, of ontologies and the multiplicity of scales and we discuss how these conceptual developments support important methods in remote sensing such as change detection and accuracy assessment. The ramifications of the different theoretical foundations between the ‘per-pixel paradigm’ and GEOBIA are analysed, as are some of the challenges along this path from pixels, to objects, to geo-intelligence. Based on several paradigm indications as defined by Kuhn and based on an analysis of peer-reviewed scientific literature we conclude that GEOBIA is a new and evolving paradigm.},

This method can be utilized as a basis for further land evaluation and land use planning in large territories. The approach was tested in the state of Michoacan, central-western Mexico, currently undergoing rapid deforestation and subsequent land degradation. Results at the reconnaissance level describe the geographic distribution of major landforms and dominant land cover, and provide a synoptic inventory of natural resources. Results at the semi-detailed level indicate how to nest individual landforms to major units and how they can be used to run procedures for land evaluation. If combined with appropriate socioeconomic data, governmental guidelines for land use planning can be formulated on the basis of reconnaissance and semi-detailed terrain analysis.},

In this research, we investigate the use of morphometric parameters and a new classification scheme to characterize selected elemental forms associated with landforms. We apply and test this methodology on a geomorphologically diverse region located in Central Mexico. These simple elements are known as morphometric classes and include ridge, plane, channel, pit, peak, and pass. These classes correspond to real entities and are of practical significance. The morphometric classes were grouped according to their areal parameters (ridge, plane, and channel) and pointed parameters (pit, peak, and pass), which can be used to form the basis of a system of characterization and classification of landforms. Landform elements display statistically significant compositional differences with respect to their proportions of morphometric classes. This, in turn, can be plotted onto a diagram of characterization and classification known as a double ternary diagram (DTD), which comprises both areal and pointed parameters and any combination thereof. The DTD is useful for studying geomorphological processes wherein areal and point values and properties have expressions which are topographically quantifiable.},

  Abstract                 = {The definition of soil is an important part of communication about soil, and it is important to have effective communication with other scientists, politicians, an interested public, and others with an interest in utilizing soil information. Initially soil science was focused primarily on agricultural applications, but in recent decades the use of soil information has expanded to include areas like land use planning, environmental applications, human health, and food, water, and energy security. Pedologists now include urban and other anthropogenically disturbed environments in their studies in addition to the traditional natural and agro-ecosystems. With these expansions in the application of soil information it is natural that some have raised the question of whether a new definition of soil is needed. Here we investigate that question by exploring whether the traditional pedologic definition of soil is meaningful in the modern world, with its expanded applications for soil knowledge. The current pedologic definition of soil includes the following key elements: (i) soils are natural bodies, (ii) soils are both spatial and temporal, (iii) soils form at the surface, (iv) soils are the result of complex biogeochemical and physical processes, (v) soils are capable of supporting life, and (vi) soils can be mapped at appropriate scales. We conclude that a definition that includes the six key elements listed above, with perhaps some minor modifications, is able to incorporate the expanded applications of soil information in the modern world.},

Methods of fuzzy k-means have been used by other workers to overcome the problem of class overlap but their usefulness may be reduced when data sets are large and when the data include artefacts introduced by the derivation of landform attributes from gridded digital elevation models. This paper presents ways to overcome these limitations using spatial sampling methods, statistical modelling of the derived stream topology, and fuzzy k-means using the Distance metric. Using data from Alberta, Canada, and the French pre-Alps it is shown how these methods may easily create meaningful, spatially coherent landform classes from high resolution gridded DEMs.},

  Review                   = {evt sind das nur anfängliche Ausschnitte: Several segmentation parameters were tested to create object primitives according to both spatial features and derivatives values. These objects are defined to maxi- mize between-object variability and minimize within object variability for user-chosen inputs. For the resulting segmentation level, the user specifies a unitless ‘scale parameter’. Layers containing objects of different sizes can be created as appropriate. For homogeneity, the user chooses the relative weight to be applied to color versus shape criteria; 0.7:0.3 was used here (the sum must total 1.0), emphasizing the importance of within object heterogeneity over the shape of the resulting features. Within the shape parameter settings, smoothness and compactness parameters were weighted equally. These settings assure relatively ‘natural’ boundaries for resulting segments, avoiding both fractal shapes and artificially compressed objects. Equal weights were assigned to the four input bands (profile curvature, plan curvature, slope gradient and altitude). In the segmentation algorithm used (Baatz and Schäpe, 2000), the ‘scale parameter’ is a measure of the maximum change in total heterogeneity that may occur when merging two image objects in a stepwise process. Internally, this value is squared and serves as the threshold which terminates the region-merging segmentation process. When a possible merge of a pair of image objects is examined, a fusion value for the objects is calculated and compared to the squared scale parameter. The color criterion (in our case values for slope gradient, curvature, etc.) is the change in heterogeneity that occurs when merging two image objects, as described by the change of the weighted standard deviation of the derivatives values regarding their weightings. The above-mentioned ‘shape parameter’ works in a similar fashion: the shape criterion is a value that describes the enhancement of the shape with regard to two different models describing ideal shapes. Adjusting the scale parameter indirectly influences the average object size: a larger value leads to bigger objects and vice versa. Additionally, the influence of shape as well as the image's channels on the object homogeneity can be adjusted. During the segmentation process all generated image objects are linked to each other automatically. For both the Romanian and German data sets, four layers of segmented objects were generated using scale parameters of 300, 200, 30 and 10. The outputs were visually analyzed by draping them over the DTMs of the study areas. Statistics of the resulting image object primitives were also compared (Table 2). The scale parameter of 30 seems to be the best compromise between getting ‘meaningful’ segments and avoiding an over-segmentation which produces a scattered classification. It is dif- ficult to evaluate the meaningfulness of the segmentation level and this is the most crucial part of using the algorithm of Baatz and Schäpe (2000). In this study it is done by comparing the results at the respective levels with dissecting the terrain manually through interpretation and the level of best agreement is chosen. The corresponding scale parameter results in segments which delineate medium landforms well, although sometimes one object might belong to two or three types of slopes, especially in terms of plane curvature (Fig. 6a, object 1). These shortcomings are drastically reduced when high resolution DTMs are used (Fig. 6, bottom-left). Larger objects would be more suitable to extract toeslopes, but at a greater level of heterogeneity all other segments will lose their meaning as medium-sized landforms. The chosen level of homo-geneity is regarded as the best compromise between producing too small objects and objects being so large that they belong to several landforms at once.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we demonstrate artificial neural networks—self-organizing map (SOM)—as a semi-automatic method for extraction and analysis of landscape elements in the man and biosphere reserve “Eastern Carpathians”. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) collected data to produce generally available digital elevation models (DEM). Together with Landsat Thematic Mapper data, this provides a unique, consistent and nearly worldwide data set. To integrate the {DEM} with Landsat data, it was re-projected from geographic coordinates to {UTM} with 28.5&#xa0;m spatial resolution using cubic convolution interpolation. To provide quantitative morphometric parameters, first-order (slope) and second-order derivatives of the DEM—minimum curvature, maximum curvature and cross-sectional curvature—were calculated by fitting a bivariate quadratic surface with a window size of 9×9 pixels. These surface curvatures are strongly related to landform features and geomorphological processes. Four morphometric parameters and seven Landsat-enhanced thematic mapper (ETM+) bands were used as input for the {SOM} algorithm. Once the network weights have been randomly initialized, different learning parameter sets, e.g. initial radius, final radius and number of iterations, were investigated. An optimal {SOM} with 20 classes using 1000 iterations and a final neighborhood radius of 0.05 provided a low average quantization error of 0.3394 and was used for further analysis. The effect of randomization of initial weights for optimal {SOM} was also studied. Feature space analysis, three-dimensional inspection and auxiliary data facilitated the assignment of semantic meaning to the output classes in terms of landform, based on morphometric analysis, and land use, based on spectral properties. Results were displayed as thematic map of landscape elements according to form, cover and slope. Spectral and morphometric signature analysis with corresponding zoom samples superimposed by contour lines were compared in detail to clarify the role of morphometric parameters to separate landscape elements. The results revealed the efficiency of {SOM} to integrate {SRTM} and Landsat data in landscape analysis. Despite the stochastic nature of SOM, the results in this particular study are not sensitive to randomization of initial weight vectors if many iterations are used. This procedure is reproducible for the same application with consistent results. },

  Review                   = {METHODISCHES: fixed window size (Wood 2009, LANDSERF) The variability of land characteristics is largely controlled by changes in the form and position of the terrain which produce gradients in moisture, energy, and nutrients across the landscape (Moore et al. 1993, Skidmore et al. Landform classification is one of the basic research domains in digital terrain analysis (Pike 2002). Therefore, classification schemes based on general geomorphometry are less common compared to vast amounts of classification schemes based on specific geomorphometry. As a result, classification attempts often end up with products that have restricted use and lack interoperability. Therefore, incorporating fuzzy classification methods is highly recommended in handling the aforementioned ambiguities in landform classification. Between the similarity relation model and the semantic import (SI) model, which are the two implementations of fuzzy classification, the SI model is utilized for this study. The SI model permits definition of conceptual landform elements using imprecise semantics (MacMillan et al. 2000, Dehn et al. 2001) and there is a progress toward more stable semantics-oriented definitions of terrain units (Strobl 2008). The SI model utilizes morphometric DTMs as input into a multivariate fuzzy classification. The geomorphometric context information for this study is comprised of ‘relative terrain position,’ for example, relatively low, high, and ‘terrain network,’ that is, streams and ridges. Together they determine the contextual information particular to landscapes, for example, connectivity and proximity. Incorporation of the geomorphometric context requires representing terrain as interrelated entities and building relationships structured in a multi-level hierarchy to aid in contextual classification. Therefore, the multi-level classification capabilities of OBIA are utilized. Methods: derivation of dems at different window sizes, Subsequently, OBIA was implemented to produce homogeneous form objects based on local geometry; those objects were then reorganized using contextual information to produce geomorphometric classes. Regions: Case 1’ has high relief, dissected valleys, and steep hill slopes that dominate the landscape such that the region can be dated to a young stage geomorphology. The topography of ‘case 2’ is smoother when compared to ‘case 1’; there are hills that dominate the landscape, and the remaining part is comprised of gently sloping regions. landform classes=Dikau’s (1989) scheme, which exhaustively covers all possible combinations of form, described with morphometric DTMs (Figure 2) is adopted for this study. (slope and four curvatures) THE CURVATURE IS CALCULATED FOR A SPECIFIC LOCATION USING A SERIES OF WINDOW SIZES. WINDOW SIZE WHICH CALCULATES THE HIGHEST CURVATURE CALUE REPRESENTS THE CHARACTERISTIC SCALE (WOOD 1996, IMPLEMENTED IN LANDSERF) However, this method, when applied to case studies, produced unstable results for different window size ranges, Moreover, this method tends to recognize larger features as dominant as stated also by Barringer (2008). The scale represented by window size of 45 × 45 (675 × 675 m on the ground) has the highest global mean of convexity for ‘case 1’; for ‘case 2’ it is the second highest; Threshold criteria cannot be accepted as global, because of the multi-scalar nature of landforms and case specificity. Therefore, normalized values of DTMs are suggested as an alternative for a consistent classification in this study.Normalization of the DTMs enables the use of same set of classification criteria for all of the cases at different data ranges and bears out model validity. Topography is assumed flat if it has a slope lower than 5◦ (Giles 1998), 4◦ (MacMillan and Shary 2009), or 3◦ (Reuter et al. 2006). SEGMENTATION: ecognition, multi-resolution segmentation based on the fractal net evaluation algorithm by Baatz and Schäpe (2000) embedded in eCognition software was employed to obtain form objects from slope and four curvature parameters. Segmenetation scale determined with ESP-tool. All input layers are weighted the same; shape criterion is set to 0.1, which automatically gives the weight of 0.9 to morphometric DTMs. An increased weight of shape is observed as posing misrepresentative objects of terrain features, as 2D representations of terrain features do not usually have particular shapes. fuzzy classification of landforms based on their local geometry: SI models that utilize fuzzy membership functions require two parameters to be defined: (1) type of curves (e.g., linear, bell-shaped), and (2) threshold values: a, b. Classification based on local geometry produces classes that are ‘morphometric’ rather than geomorphometric (Wood 1996). Thus: Relative position across the landscape is incorporated to construct this organization. Contextual information that reveals the relative position of features across the landscape is gathered from a local elevation-based model ‘terrain position index’ categorized into three as ‘upper,’ ‘mid,’ and ‘low.’ Major streams and ridges that represent the ‘terrain network’ are obtained through surface flow model to provide guidance in allocating objects into surface-specific landforms like‘ridge,’ ‘peak,’ and ‘channel.’ A set of logical rules that utilize information from the sub-level, super-level, and thematic layers is processed in ‘Level 0.’ Geomorphometric classification makes a reorganization of morphometric classes through incorporation of contextual information. Some of the landforms are reclassified according to logical rules that represent class descriptions. Consequently, there is approximately 10% change in class type of the objects; this change occurs more between some of the classes: there are shifts from, for example, ‘plain’ to ‘channel’ and ‘shoulder’ and ‘spur’ to ‘ridge’ due to geomorphometric context information. Conclusion: OBIA proved to be an efficient tool in obtaining representative terrain objects rather than scattered pixels. It is confirmed to be powerful in utilizing information from different levels within the framework of geomorphometric context. However, this method employed a loose coupling of form, position, and terrain network and it can be improved into a more sophisticated and structured system that represents the particular organization of terrain. OBIA provides multilevel segmentation that helps represent scale. However, the multi-level framework provided by OBIA is rather utilized for classification purposes in this study; it enabled athering information content from different levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the variety of statistical methods available for static modeling of plant distribution, few studies directly compare methods on a common data set. In this paper, the predictive power of Generalized Linear Models (GLM) versus Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) models of plant distribution in the Spring Mountains of Nevada, USA, are compared. Results show that GLM models give better predictions than CCA models because a species- specific subset of explanatory variables can be selected in GLM, while in CCA, all species are modeled using the same set of composite environmental variables (axes). Although both techniques can be readily ported to a Geographical Information System (GIS), CCA models are more readily implemented for many species at once. Predictions from both techniques rank the species models in the same order of quality; i.e. a species whose distribution is well modeled by GLM is also well modeled by CCA and vice-versa. In both cases, species for which model predictions have the poorest accuracy are either disturbance or fire related, or species for which too few observations were available to calibrate and evaluate the model. Each technique has its advantages and drawbacks. In general GLM will provide better species specific-models, but CCA will provide a broader overview of multiple species, diversity, and plant communities.},

This study describes a terrain analysis method that combines modeled and defined gcomorphographic terrain attributes with detailed field knowledge and local mapping experience. 450 forest soil profiles were used to statistically analyze the correlation to soil properties. The result is a two-stage hierarchical terrain classification approach that provides a differentiated and satisfactory reproduction of characteristic terrain attributes in the primary landscape units. As field surveys show, modeled steep slopes, ridges, slope edges, convex and concave slope formations correlate well to local landform elements. Up to now, the results for mid slope modeling have been unsatisfactory. Furthermore, non-relevant or incorrectly delimitated landform elements were also modeled, making manual correction indispensible. In order for terrain modeling to be feasible it is necessary to entail detailed terrain knowledge of the region to be modeled. In this study, statistical analyses of the correlation between soil properties and modeled landform elements were conducted. The results show that steep slopes, convex and concave slope formations, steep stream channels and rock faces correlate well to soil properties. A few single relations were found for plateaus and ridges and trough-shaped valleys. Slope edges and mid slopes show almost no characteristic soil properties. Modeled landform elements are the most essential predictor for the development of prediction models for forest soil properties. The complex morphographic terrain classification approach, described in this study, is a feasible spatial and hierarchical basis for decision-based prediction models.}},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of habitat factors for the distribution of vegetation based on the analysis of landform characteristics is an important aspect in the process of understanding high mountain ecology. Therefore in the present study a GIS and remote sensing based approach is followed to produce different scale vegetation maps for a study area in the Western Alps (Switzerland). As spatial information on site factors is commonly lacking in mountain areas, the use of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a potential substitute for use in vegetation analyses, as it highly correlates with temperature, moisture, geomorphological processes and disturbance factors. Thus it is crucial to analyse the capabilities of a DEM for indicating habitat conditions in a landscape characterised by high topodiversity and a patchwork of microclimatic habitats. Appropriate landform parameters have been derived, indicating temperature and moisture distribution, exposure towards wind, snow etc. Using contingency tables and principal components analysis the overall influence of topography and landform on vegetation distribution was analysed. Nevertheless, the lack of information on the human dimension leads to some uncertainties in the interpretation of spatial patterns of vegetation. Additionally landform classification schemes decomposing the landscape into basic landform-elements only proved useful for characterising azonal, non-altitudinal vegetation classes.},

  Review                   = {Hoersch et al analysed th relation ship between vegatation and landform in an Alpine region using landformform objects derieved based on geomorphometric parametrs. For landform delineation they applied one method (Saga) that creates 3 classes of hydrological importance (depressions, intermediate areas, and vertices) and one method the creates the 9 classes from Dikau (1988)!! The additional classes of the second approach did not lead additional information but complicated interpretaion. However they reach the conclusion that their chosen classifciations are not specially useful for habitat modeling.. They also noticed that intermediate regsion (slope) dominate mountaineous areas! PCA! They however emphasize the importance of the differen landform paretmers(15) and that 8-9 PC were needed , therefore the data is high-dimensional. The human factor should also alwys be kept in mind!! The pixelwise geomorphomtetrci approch showed important relationships between the terrain parameters and vegetation, but landform units did not really improve ther results or interpretations. stats:As the vegetation data are on the nominal scale (i.e. group names), the only appropriate method to analyse correlations is the contingency table for non-metric factor data. Thus the landform parameters had to be transferred into nominal data, therefore classes were used instead of raw values. Contingency tables are used to compare actual distributions with theoretical, i.e. normal distributions by means of 2 -tests. POINT VALIDATION: Although satellite classification results are rather good, the use of validation points for accuracy assessment is not uncritical, because errors tend to cluster and thus are not equally distributed throughout the area (compare (Campbell, 1981; Congalton, 1988; Goodchild, 1994, S. 621)).},

  Abstract                 = {The advent of quantitative soil-landscape modelling techniques has seen the mapping of pedological phenomena placed on a more scientific footing. In New Zealand, the spatial distribution of loess has a significant influence on soil properties, and recent regional-scale quantitative models have attempted to model the thickness and pattern of this important soil parent material. Here we apply two quantitative modelling techniques, automatic landform stratification and environmental correlation, to test and refine loess-landscape models for a higher-resolution study window in North Otago, South Island. Field validation demonstrated that previously developed coarse-scale models were moderately successful in predicting loess thickness, but these models required refinement. Automatic landform stratification based on conceptual models of loess distribution was a good predictor of primary loess in the field (85% success), but predicted poorly occurrence of colluvial and thin loess. Environmental correlation using nominal logistic regression with equal prior probabilities was a good predictor of primary loess in the field (70% success), but predicted poorly occurrence of colluvial and thin loess. Quantitative loess-landscape models need to be further refined using higher-resolution terrain data derived from LIDAR and photogrammetric surveys. In addition, morphometric similarities between different loess landscapes needs to be addressed and the historical and spatial contingency inherent in loess-landscape evolution incorporated in models for improved spatial prediction of loess parent materials.},

Continuous classification (fuzzy set) methods and unsupervised (ISODATA) classifica- tion techniques were used to classify the landscape of a study area in southwestern Wisconsin, USA. Each pixel of a 10-m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) was grouped according to its membership in a continuous landform class. These classes were d~mnined by tt~ natural clustering of the data in attribute space. Attributes used for the classification were elevation, slope, profile and tangent (related to plan) curvature, compound topographic (wetness) index, and incident solar radiation. The ISODATA classification assigned pixels to one, and only one, landform class while the continuous classification allocated relative class memberships to each pixel. The resulting classifications roughly follow subjective manual delineation lines but give more detailed results. These classification methods may prove useful for statistical analyses and determination of sample schemes.},

  Abstract                 = {An iterative procedure that implements the classification of continuous topography as a problem in digital image-processing automatically divides an area into categories of surface form; three taxonomic criteria–slope gradient, local convexity, and surface texture–are calculated from a square-grid digital elevation model (DEM). The sequence of programmed operations combines twofold-partitioned maps of the three variables converted to greyscale images, using the mean of each variable as the dividing threshold. To subdivide increasingly subtle topography, grid cells sloping at less than mean gradient of the input DEM are classified by designating mean values of successively lower-sloping subsets of the study area (nested means) as taxonomic thresholds, thereby increasing the number of output categories from the minimum 8 to 12 or 16. Program output is exemplified by 16 topographic types for the world at 1-km spatial resolution (SRTM30 data), the Japanese Islands at 270 m, and part of Hokkaido at 55 m. Because the procedure is unsupervised and reflects frequency distributions of the input variables rather than pre-set criteria, the resulting classes are undefined and must be calibrated empirically by subsequent analysis. Maps of the example classifications reflect physiographic regions, geological structure, and landform as well as slope materials and processes; fine-textured terrain categories tend to correlate with erosional topography or older surfaces, coarse-textured classes with areas of little dissection. In Japan the resulting classes approximate landform types mapped from airphoto analysis, while in the Americas they create map patterns resembling Hammond's terrain types or surface-form classes; SRTM30 output for the United States compares favorably with Fenneman's physical divisions. Experiments are suggested for further developing the method; the Arc/Info AML and the map of terrain classes for the world are available as online downloads.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a novel method for classification and mapping of landform elements from a {DEM} based on the principle of pattern recognition rather than differential geometry. At the core of the method is the concept of geomorphon (geomorphologic phonotypes) — a simple ternary pattern that serves as an archetype of a particular terrain morphology. A finite number of 498 geomorphons constitute a comprehensive and exhaustive set of all possible morphological terrain types including standard elements of landscape, as well as unfamiliar forms rarely found in natural terrestrial surfaces. A single scan of a {DEM} assigns an appropriate geomorphon to every cell in the raster using a procedure that self-adapts to identify the most suitable spatial scale at each location. As a result, the method classifies landform elements at a range of different spatial scales with unprecedented computational efficiency. A general purpose geomorphometric map — an interpreted map of topography — is obtained by generalizing allgeomorphons to a small number of the most common landform elements. Due to the robustness and high computational efficiency of the method high resolution geomorphometric maps having continental and even global extents can be generated from giga-cell DEMs. Such maps are a valuable new resource for both manual and automated geomorphometric analyses. In order to demonstrate a practical application of this new method, a 30&#xa0;m cell−&#xa0;1 geomorphometric map of the entire country of Poland is generated and the features and potential usage of this map are briefly discussed. The computer implementation of the method is outlined. The code is available in the public domain.},

  Review                   = {IMPLEMENTED IN GRASS 7 Allgemein: most existing methods of automated landform classification have their roots in differential geometry. The differences between different existing approaches focus on how to best utilize the information contained in geomorphometric variables, and on the choice of target units of classification. Methods can be divided into those which are cell-based and those which are oject based. They can be also divided into those which use a classifier designed manually on the basis of expert knowledge and empirical evidence and those which use a classifier generated by a machine learning algorithm Finally, methods can be divided with respect to target units of classification (Minar and Evans, 2008); considered units include: landforms, landform elements, and physio graphic units (für zitate siehe paper). NOVEL APPORACH THAT DEPARTS FROM EXISTING METHODOLOGIES: we classify landform elements using tools of computer vision rather than tools of differential geometry. Thus, our algorithm attempts to mimic the classification process carried out by a human analyst. Image texture refers to the spatial arrangement of grayscale intensities in a selected region of an image. we utilize the concept of Local Ternary Patterns (LTP) (Liao, 2010) to identify local landform elements. The set of all possible LTPs is finite (498). Geomorphons are fundamental micro-structures of landscape. Instead of using a fixed-size neighborhood to collect elevation values for determination of LTP, we use a neighborhood with size and shape that self-adapts to the local topography. This self-adaptation technique utilizes the line-of-sight principle (Lee, 1991; Nagy, 1994; Yokoyama et al., 2002) and ensures that landforms are identified at their most appropriate spatial scale. We demonstrate how to generate a map of the 10 most common landform elements (peak, ridge, shoulder, spur, slope, hollow, footslope, valley, pit, and flat) using geomorphons. local ternary patterns: looks at 8 neighbours, gives them the values lower,same,equal. In practive however the quantity derived from line-of-sight-principle is used instead of simply the elevation values. By using different L-values (lookup-distance) landform elements can be identified on a wider range of scales than with the grid-based neighbourhood. CLASSIFICATION INTO 10 LANDFORMS: While traversing a LTP in order of principal directions a “transition” is a change in ternary element. Thus geomorphons flat, peak, and pit have 0 transitions, as all ternary elements in their patterns are the same. Shoulder, spur, hollow, and valley have 2 transitions, while ridge, valley, and slope have 4 transitions. We have chosen a reclassification formula based on a particular lookup table constructed on the basis of similarity between ternary patterns representing the geomorphons; patterns are similar if they have similar number of different ternary elements. GOOD DESCRIPTION OF HOW THEY COMPARED THEIR APPROACH TO THOSE OF WOOD and DIKAU with GRASS: other methods are incomplete.., it is possible to merge (Schmidt and Hewitt, 2004) Wood's and Dikau's classification schemes into a single scheme showing all 15 landform types, but needs fuzzy classification (computational cost!) SCALE FLEXIBILITY: The geomorphons method does not use a fixed-size neighborhood, instead the size and the shape of a neighborhood from which the land- form element is determined adjusts automatically to the geometry of the local terrain. The value of L determines the maximum scale at which we can find the landform element; it needs to be set to a relatively large value in order for the map to show landform elements at a broad range of scales. The inner, irregular octagons are determined by the LOS-principle in the 8 principle directions. Increasing L values converge to same result. CONCLUSION: Geomorphons represent a paradigm shift in DEM classification. First, the method is underpinned by principles of machine vision rather than differential geometry. Second, it classifies landforms at different spatial scales simultaneously.},

The original 15 facets can be grouped to reflect differences in complexity of the area or scale of application. Research testing suggests that a consolidation from 15 to 3 or 4 units provides practical, relevant separations at a farmeld scale.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Land component boundaries often coincide with transitions in environmental land properties such as soil, climate and biology. Image segmentation is an effective method for delineating terrain morphological units from digital elevation models (DEMs). This paper compares the land components derived from five DEMs. The second version of the 30-m advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global \{DEM\} (ASTER GDEM2), the 90-m shuttle radar topography mission \{DEM\} (SRTM DEM), two versions of the 5-m Stellenbosch University \{DEMs\} (SUDEM \{L1\} and L2) and a 5-m \{DEM\} (GEOEYE DEM) derived from GeoEye stereo-images were considered. The \{SRTM\} \{DEM\} and the \{ASTER\} \{GDEM2\} were upsampled to 5-m resolution for comparison purposes. Land components were delineated using the slope gradient and aspect derivatives of each DEM. The resulting land components were visually inspected and quantitatively analyzed using the slope gradient standard deviation (SGSD) measure and the mean slope gradient local variance (MSGLV) ratio. The results show that the \{GEOEYE\} \{DEM\} and \{SUDEM\} \{L2\} yielded land components with relatively low \{SGSD\} values and that their boundaries often coincide with morphological discontinuities. The \{GEOEYE\} \{DEM\} produced land components with the highest \{MSGLV\} ratio, followed by \{SUDEM\} L2, \{ASTER\} GDEM2, \{SRTM\} \{DEM\} and \{SUDEM\} L1. Although the land components derived from \{SRTM\} \{DEM\} and \{SUDEM\} \{L1\} were relatively homogeneous internally, their boundaries did not always trace morphological discontinuities. The \{ASTER\} \{GDEM2\} failed to incorporate many of the morphological discontinuities in the study area. It is concluded that, although the \{SRTM\} \{DEM\} is more suitable than the \{ASTER\} \{GDEM2\} for generating land components, higher-resolution \{DEMs\} such as the \{GEOEYE\} \{DEM\} and \{SUDEM\} \{L2\} are required for delineating meaningful land components.},

  Abstract                 = {We developed a three-step algorithm to automate the recognition and segmentation of hillslopes across ridges and valleys using a gridded digital elevation model (DEM). The first step involves the delineation of a side-slope profile by locating the lower and upper boundaries. In the second step, the cross-profile pattern of a ridge or a valley floor, which is defined and bounded by a pair of side slopes, is examined in order to distinguish upland flats from ridges and lowlands from valley floors. The width and gradient of these landform units are also measured. In the third step, a side-slope profile is segmented into lower, mid-, and upper slopes, with a line-simplification algorithm to identify changes and breaks in the slope. In this step, the footslope and crestslope can also be distinguished within the lower and upper slopes, respectively. Using a 15-m DEM, this method was applied to five sites in low- to high-relief fluvial landscapes in Japan. The results showed good agreement (86.9 ± 2.7%) with manual slope segmentation, indicating the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {Land surface morphology is fundamental to geomorphological mapping and many GIS applications. Review and comparison of various approaches to segmentation of the land surface reveals common features, and permits development of a broad theoretical basis for segmentation and for characterization of segments and their boundaries. Within the context of defining landform units that maximise internal homogeneity and external differences, this paper introduces the concept of elementary forms (segments, units) defined by constant values of fundamental morphometric properties and limited by discontinuities of the properties. The basic system of form-defining properties represents altitude and its derivatives, constant values of which provide elementary forms with various types of homogeneity. Every geometric type of elementary form can be characterized by a defining function, which is a specific case of the general polynomial fitted function. Various types of boundary discontinuity and their connections and transformations into other types of morphological unit boundaries are analysed. The wealth of types of elementary forms and their boundaries is potentially unbounded and thus is sufficient to cover the real variety of landforms. Elementary forms in the basic set proposed here have clear potential for genetic and dynamic interpretation. A brief worked example documents the possibility of analytical computation of various models of ideal elementary forms for particular segments of landform. Ideal elementary forms can be considered as attractors, to which the affinity of surface segments can be measured by multivariate statistical methods. The use of the concept of elementary forms inlandscape segmentation is promising and it could be adapted for elementary segmentation of various other spatial fields.},

Only a few authors discuss the strict definition of landform segments and the minimisation of subjective factors in the segmentation process. Looking for objectivity.. The basic geomorphological goal of land surface segmentation should be to distinguish segments (elements) that are homogeneous genetically and therefore also morphologically. #3 types of relief units: elementary(geometric simplicity) forms, landforms (composite forms) and land systems (characteristic patterns of form associations). #The connections between elevation, gravity and geomorphic processes permit genetic interpretations of elementary forms. Therefore the recognition of a physical-geometric analytical system of basic types of elementary landform unit provides the skeleton of land surface segmentation theory. A modern concept of land surface segmentation should also take into account uncertainties in the iden- tification of discontinuities and in the degree of mem- bership of a given individual form to a form type (see e.g. Schmidt and Hewitt, 2004; Schmidt et al., 2005). ######REVIEW OF LAND SURFACE SEGMENTATION########## Traditional geomorphological mapping was developed predominantly on a morphogenetic basis (e.g. Demek, 1972; Spiridonov, 1975; De Graaff et al., 1987). #Graph-based: primary goal is boundary-identification. System of morphological units and their boundaries presented by Savigear (1965): Facets (plane surface area) and segments (smoothly curved area) meet at discontinuities. A more comprehensive and theoretical application of the graph-based approach is the segmentation model of Lastoczkin (1987, 1991): structural lines and characteristic points defining elementary surfaces. He later introduced plan curvatures (zero isoline) #classificatory: Br\"{a}ndli 1996:focus on internal properties of elementary forms. among other problems; scale dependency, arbitrary thresholds. The use of numerical taxonomy (cluster analysis) in the framework of a parametric approach (Speight, 1974) attempts to overcome this artificial character and preserve the synthetic nature of the landform units defined by a set of properties. Problem:classification is based on thematic similarity alone, ignoring position. --Evans signature approach: Statistical characteristics of morphometric properties of a known set of landforms can lead to the identification of other landforms of a given type. ######A new system: the concept of elementary forms#################### Boundaries ideally sensed as lines of discontinuity of some characters, and homogeneity ideally defined by uniformity of relevant characters, can provide the link between statistical approaches and basic analytical concepts. Homogeneity of genetic influence is therefore reflected by morphometric homogeneity (uniformity) of landform, and change of genetic influence is connected with morphometric discontinuity. Theoretically we can model land surface form with elements defined by constant values of morphometric properties within the full set M (derivatives of elevation). The use of more types of element allows a better approximation of reality, but their interpretability is a limitation. As yet, properties up to the third order seem to be interpretable and thus effectively usable now, but the system is open to further development. "Then we can define ideal elementary forms as landform elements with a constant value of altitude, or of two or more readily interpretable morphometric variables, bounded by lines of discontinuity. The constant values which define the elementary form are termed the form-defining properties. VARIABLES: altitude, aspect, gradient, plan curvature,aspect change, normal gradient change, normal change of radius of plan curvature, normal change of gradien change, normal change of change of radius of plan curvature. Forms are distinguished by positive or negative values of the form-defining criteria. Each ideal elementary form has its own equation / function ##BOUNDARIES OF ELEMENTARY FORM###### #discontinuities - between two elementary forms, with a boundary-defining porperty(simple or compound discontinuity). Theoretical discussion on boundaries... A major difference between this concept of elementary forms and some dynamically and genetically based approaches is the strict separation of elementary form delimitation and its subsequent dynamic and genetic characterization. #Exclusion of non-morphometric and positional variables from initial form definition The importance of regional variables (such as basins) for land classification is beyond doubt. But their mixing with local variables in algorithms for identification of boundaries can be problematic for segmentation. #attractors:stable states to which development tends, they will be both more frequent and more interpretable. Understanding elementary forms as attractors can provide a bridge between analytical approaches to landform delimitation starting from mathematical analysis, and statistical approaches using mainly multivariate statistical methods. Individual elementary forms can be defined by contiguous clustering fromform-defining properties (or their derivatives). Integra- tion of graph-based approaches with preliminary identification of discontinuities into a classification algorithm (e.g. Dymond et al., 1995; Giles and Franklin, 1998) is therefore promising. For defining the affinity of a real surface segment to an ideal elementary form may be expressed by fuzzy classification (membership function).},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Topographic position index (TPI) is an algorithm increasingly used to measure topographic slope positions and to automate landform classifications. We applied {TPI} to a geoarchaeological research project in northwestern Belgium but its use led to erroneous landform classifications in this heterogeneous landscape. We asked whether deviation from mean elevation (DEV) was a better method for landform classification than TPI. We found that it enabled more accurate geomorphological assessment when using northwestern Belgium as a case study.},

  Abstract                 = {The aims of this paper are: to compare different data mining algorithms for modelling soil visible–near infrared (vis–NIR: 350–2500&#xa0;nm) diffuse reflectance spectra and to assess the interpretability of the results. We compared multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), boosted trees (BT) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC), clay content (CC) and pH measured in water (pH). The comparisons were also performed using a selected set of wavelet coefficients from a discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Feature selection techniques to reduce model complexity and to interpret and evaluate the models were tested. The dataset consists of 1104 samples from Australia. Comparisons were made in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE), the corresponding \{R2\} and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Ten-fold-leave-group out cross validation was used to optimise and validate the models. Predictions of the three soil properties by \{SVM\} using all vis–NIR wavelengths produced the smallest \{RMSE\} values, followed by \{MARS\} and PLSR. \{RF\} and especially \{BT\} were out-performed by all other approaches. For all techniques, implementing them on a reduced number of wavelet coefficients, between 72 and 137 coefficients, produced better results. Feature selection (FS) using the variable importance for projection (FSVIP) returned 29–31 selected features, while \{FSMARS\} returned between 11 and 14 features. DWT–ANN produced the smallest \{RMSE\} of all techniques tested followed by FSVIP–ANN and FSMARS–ANN. However, both the FSVIP–ANN and FSMARS–ANN models used a smaller number of features for the predictions than DWT–ANN. This is reflected in their AIC, which suggests that, when both the accuracy and parsimony of the model are taken into consideration, the best \{SOC\} model was the FSMARS–ANN, and the best \{CC\} and pH models were those from FSVIP–ANN. Analysis of the selected bands shows that: (i) \{SOC\} is related to wavelengths indicating C―O, C═O, and N―H compounds, (ii) \{CC\} is related to wavelengths indicating minerals, and (iii) pH is related to wavelengths indicating both minerals and organic material. Thus, the results are sensible and can be used for comparison to other soils. A systematic comparison like the one presented here is important as the nature of the target function has a strong influence on the performance of the different algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil development is intimately tied to the slopes on which soils form. Soils across slopes are connected, process-wise, like links in a chain. This analogy has led to the concept of a catena – a term for a series of soils on a slope. This chapter explores the reasons for soil variation on catenas, focusing on (1) debris and moisture flux along the slope and (2) depth to the water table. Fluxes of sediment, commonly facilitated by water, vary predictably as a function of position on the slope, leading to soils that may be thinner or thicker than expected on steep slope segments where runoff is accentuated. Conversely, soils on lower, flatter slope segments may be overthickened from many years of slow but episodic sediment accumulations from upslope; when sediment accumulations are particularly fast or large, soils here can become buried. Soil texture and infiltration capacities dramatically impact these processes; on slopes composed of coarser, more permeable materials, catenary position is less important because there is less runoff, and thus, even on the steepest slope segments, much of the water infiltrates vertically. Water tables, commonly deepest on the steepest slope segments, vary predictably as a function of position on the slope. High water tables can dramatically affect internal soil processes, as well as weathering and related phenomena.},

  Review                   = {Schmidt and Hewitt present and automated land element classification based on two steps. First, local geometry (cruvature and slope) is used to differentitate 15 form elements applying fuzzy membership functions. In a second step, topographic psoition is computed using a fuzzy expansion of the TOP HAT approch (Rodriguez et al 2002) to incorporate spatial terrain context. A rule set is then applied to combine the two models. Schmidt and Hewitt identify two fundamental properties of landelements, local geometry at different scales and spatial context. Schmidt and Hewitt state the impossibility of attaining a unique and unambiguous classifiction due toe uncertainty attached to semantic descriptions and the applied descriptors. They stress the importance of scale regarding the calculation of terrain parameters for soil-landscape modelling Testing was done by applying the classicigation to the soil attribute rooting depth. Schmidt and Hewitt discuss the advantage of discontinous soil-landscape models for applied use due to their intuitivity. The classifications are those used for describing fundamental terrain units at the hilsslope scale (mikrorelief after Dikau 19898).
